In order to make Sempedia genuiinely useful, several things need to be addressed. Currently one particularly useful feature is that when a triple is described the object of the triple immediately becomes a new object within Sempedia. This is good except in cases where the object is not really an object but for example a number. If this were to be displayed in the object search then the list will be extremely long and messy.

Moreover users are unlikely to want to to "faceted browsing" for exact matches of non-object values like numbers. They are more likely going to want to specify a range of parameters (e.g. numbers) and match all items that fit the criteria.
