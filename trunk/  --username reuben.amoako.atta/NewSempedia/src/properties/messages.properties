A semantic tag is made of two components, the predicate (which describes the relationship between this object and the Object or Value you will specify. An example predicate might be &quot;city of birth&quot; and the object/value may be &quot;Paris&quot;. Once you submit tag other users will be able to browse it. Happy tagging.
